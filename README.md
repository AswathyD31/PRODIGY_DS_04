# **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**

## **Task 3 Submission:**

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and sentiment analysis on a social media dataset, uncovering sentiment patterns and public attitudes towards various brands and topics through detailed visualizations.

## Dataset Description
____________

The dataset consists of social media posts related to different brands, containing sentiment labels and the actual tweet content. It helps in analyzing how people feel about specific topics or brands.

### Key Columns:

* **Tweet_ID:** Unique identifier for each tweet.

* **Topic:** The brand or subject discussed.

* **Sentiment::** Sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant).

* **Tweet:** The social media text.

## Tools and Libraries Used
__________________
 * Jupyter Notebook

* Pandas for data manipulation

* NumPy for numerical operations

* Matplotlib & Seaborn for creating visualizations

* NLTK: For natural language processing (stopword removal, tokenization)

* WordCloud: For generating word cloud visualizations

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process
________________
Key steps followed during the EDA process:

**1. Data Cleaning:**

- Removed duplicate entries to avoid repetition bias.

- Standardized text: converted all text to lowercase, removed punctuation, special characters, and cleaned unnecessary elements like mentions and URLs.

- Tokenized the tweet content and removed common stopwords for clarity.

**2. Data Visualization:**

- **Sentiment Distribution:**

  * Bar plots and pie charts were created to visualize the overall sentiment distribution across all topics.
 
  * Analyzed which sentiments were more common for specific brands.

- **Brand-Specific Analysis:**

  * Filtered tweets by brands like Apple, Tesla, PUBG, and Facebook.
 
  * Visualized the sentiment breakdown for each brand to understand public perception.

- **Word Cloud Generation:**

    * Created word clouds to visualize frequently occurring words in positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
 
    * Generated brand-specific word clouds for deeper insights.

## Key Insights

* Brands like Apple and Tesla generally received positive sentiment, while topics like PUBG and Facebook showed a mix of positive, negative, and neutral reactions.

* Positive tweets commonly included words reflecting appreciation or support, while negative tweets highlighted dissatisfaction or complaints.

* The sentiment distribution varied across brands, showing differences in how the public perceives them.

## **Conclusion**
____________

This sentiment analysis uncovered meaningful insights üåü about public attitudes towards different brands on social media. The findings can help companies monitor public opinion, address concerns, and improve their communication strategies.

## **Future Enhancements**
_________

  * Build predictive models to automatically classify tweet sentiments.

  * Add time-based sentiment analysis to observe trends over time.

  * Deploy an interactive dashboard for real-time sentiment tracking.

  * Expand the analysis to include hashtags, mentions, and emojis for richer insights.

  * Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or sentiment intensity scoring.
